<h1>THE BEST KDRAMAS ACCORDING TO ME</h1>
<h2>my top 3 dramas of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>ITs OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY</h3>
<p>It's about how the title say-sometimes it's okay to not be okay.<br /> this drama has everything-comedy, romance,healing.</p>
<h3>Hometown Cha Cha Cha</h3>
<p>It's about a guy who held himself for his friend's burden. watch how he get rid of that as a pretty lady barges his boring silent life.<br />Kim Seon Ho is actually my favourite actor.</p>
<h3>Business Proposal</h3>
<p>a bit cringey yet fluffy, feel-good, romance-comedy kdrama which never gets boring.</p>
